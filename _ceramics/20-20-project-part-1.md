title: 20/20 Project Part 1
description_markdown: >-
  These works were created during my residency at the Lightbox   as part of the
  20/20 project. They  respond to the site and grounds of Woking Palace, a
  former Tudor Palace on the edge of the River Wey, in Old Woking.


  The 20/20 project was led by the UAL Decolonising Arts Ins tute and supported
  by funding from Arts Council England, the Freelands Foundation and University
  of the Arts London.
