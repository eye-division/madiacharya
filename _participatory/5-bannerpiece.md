   The Banner Piece (2006-8) was created as a part of the Public Art commissioned for a new health centre in East Oxford.It incorporates the work of participants which followed on from group discussions on health and well being with a focus on herbal remedies from around the world.Health related text in different languages such as Kurdish, Urdu and Arabic from the workshops were incorporated into this piece reflecting migration, journeys and transitions, all key issues in this community.Each banner was bound by natural twigs as a way of bringing nature into the building.
