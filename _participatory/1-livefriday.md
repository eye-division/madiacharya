  **Hope through Nature** was a workshop which formed part of  the **Livefriday** program at the **Ashmolean Museum**, Oxford in November 2016. Participants explored ideas and meaning of hope through nature and patterns around us. Images of patterns/ ideas from different cultures were a source of inspiration and participants  also brought their own ideas. Participants planed their design on paper and then developed  the design onto a wood piece, especially prepared for the workshop.
