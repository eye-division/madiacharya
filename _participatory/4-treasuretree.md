  This textile piece was commmisioned by the organisation Reading Quest.
  Children of all ages,parents and grandparents contibuted to the panel as part
  of the event 'The Gigantic Children's Treasure Hunt' held at Oxford Town Hall
  in May 2007. Participants were asked to explore the idea of 'books as
  treasure' or 'books as refuge'. The individual contributions make up the
  leaves of 'The Treasure Tree'.


  Participants came from diverse cultural backgrounds. The image of the tree can
  be a way of symbolising growth and learning as well as providing shelter and
  refuge across different cultures
