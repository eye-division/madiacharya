    image_title: Along the Archipelago
    image_description: >-
      100 x 70cm, 2015, mixed media on wooden panel - &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This
      work is inspired by the escape of the Banggai Cardinal fish from the
      Banggai Archipelago and their unexplained proliferation in other parts of
      the ocean. This seems to contract the depletion and near extinction of
      many other species due to overfishing.

    image_title: Effervescing Elderflower Elephants (1)
    image_description: >-
      30 x 25cm, 2014, Mixed media on wooden panel - &quot;&gt;This work started
      out with wooden panels, which were previous works, elderflowers were in
      season and song Effervescing Elephants by Syd Barrett was playing in the
      background. It evolved in this way from a textured surface with the
      delicate impressions of elderflowers playfully juxtaposed with elephants
      wading through.
