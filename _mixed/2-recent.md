    image_title: Along the Archipelago
    image_description: 100 x 70cm, 2015, mixed media on wooden panel - &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This work is inspired by the escape of the Banggai Cardinal fish from the Banggai Archipelago and their unexplained proliferation in other parts of the ocean.

It evolved in this way from a textured surface with the delicate impressions of elderflowers playfully juxtaposed with elephants wading through.
