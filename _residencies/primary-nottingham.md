title: Primary, Nottingham
description_markdown: >-
  During the summer of 2024 I undertook a 4 week residency at Primary ,
  Nottingham. During this period I visited the lace collection at Nottingham
  Castle. The intricate patterns  and colours of the lace costumes resonated
  with me, reminding me of patterns of South Asian textiles.


  I also visited Sherwood Forest and encountered some beautiful ancient trees
  amidst the dense green foliage and wild flowers. This experience also
  influenced my work for the residency.


  I watched a film about the Cluny lace company, who are based in Nottingham and
  employ traditional process in lace production. They very kindly donated some
  lace samples to me on request.


  Given my passion for working with found materials, I worked with  shredded
  cardboard, combining this with lace and acrylic paint to create 2 wall 
  sculptural installations.
