title: Willowbrook Residency
description_markdown: >-
  This artwork was created during a 2 week residency based ata specialist
  provision for young people with neurodivergent needs in Oxford. The work was
  especially created for the Willowbrook festival 2021.


  We explored the theme of masks. Many of us wear masks to try and negotiate
  experiences through our lives.&nbsp; Some may learn to hide their difficulties
  by wearing a mask. Also now in the midst of a global pandemic masks have taken
  on another level of meaning, a way of protecting ourselves from infection and
  ill health.


  During the residency, young people helped design and create this final piece
  installed on this tree. The work combines natural materials such as pine cones
  and materials collected from the coast and well as industrial materials found
  near the site of the residency.


  During the festival weekend at Willowbrook Farm a 2nd artwork was created with
  participants during the festival. We worked with twigs collected from the
  ancient woodland, feathers and string to create a moving sculpture between the
  trees.


  &nbsp;This project was  supported by Arts Council England and Willowbrook Farm
  Charity.
