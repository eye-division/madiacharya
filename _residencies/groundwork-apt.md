title: Groundwork APT
description_markdown: >-
  In October 2020 I completed a residency at APT Gallery, London with a group of
  artists who also share a fascination for what can be found in our environment
  as a starting point. As part of this residency I went to the Thames foreshore
  several times to collect materials and objects. I took them back to the
  gallery where I continued working with found netting and textiles. The
  textiles where from a&nbsp; silk sari which was bright yellow and red with an
  intricate pattern. As this was around the time of Covid 19 I also created a
  mask from the same fabric as a way of connecting with my work, somehow merging
  it.
