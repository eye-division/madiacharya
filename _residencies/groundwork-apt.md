title: Groundwork APT
description_markdown: >-
  In October 2020 I completed a residency at APT Gallery, London with a group of
  artists who also share a fascination for what can be found in our environment
  as a starting point for new work. As part of this residency I went to the
  Thames foreshore several times to collect materials and objects. I took these
  back to the gallery where I continued working with found netting and textiles.
  The textiles where from a silk sari which was bright yellow and red with an
  intricate pattern. As this was around the time of Covid 19 I also created a
  mask from the same sari as a way of connecting with my work, somehow merging
  with it.
