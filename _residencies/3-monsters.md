  Monster Myths, 2009


  This series of works were made during a residency at Eynsham Primary School in
  Oxfordshire through the Oxfordshire Artweeks Educational Charity, **Kids@rt**.
  Children aged between 4-11 worked with the artist to create sculptures out of
  branches, twigs lying around as well as rope, string and driftwood
  specifically collected for the project. Mythical creatures such as a dragon, a
  2 headed snake and 'Disco Monster' were constructed from these natural and
  recycled materials. Installed hanging from the trees these creatures form a
  permanent feature in this beautiful woodland
