  The Gosford Geese

  This and following works, **Goose 1-5** are from a residency I undertook at Gosford Hill School, Oxfordshire (June-July 2009) commissioned by educational charity **Kids@rt**. This is involved working with students aged 11-16 making outdoor sculptures within the school grounds using recycled materials.The theme of  ' Geese'  suggested by one of the students seemed to be in keeping with the school logo and the way geese work together in a team reflects the school's ethos. Materials used included willow, twigs, buttons, ribbon and other accessories. The staff, students and trustees from Kids@rt felt this was a  worthwhile project and the resulting artwork visually rich and interesting.
