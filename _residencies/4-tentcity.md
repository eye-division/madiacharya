  and involved a series of tents with different themes and ideas. I was lead

      3m x 6m, 2007, Found fishing nets,plastic,rubber and metallic wire - This
      work was created for 'Refuge Tent', as part of the InTent City project. I
      worked with the culturally diverse communities in East Oxford to expore
      issues around migration, shelter and what gives us a sense of home.
      Through this participatory project I ;wanted to share how the process of
      collecting can function as a way of re-interpreting past experiences and
      creating new meanings. This was shown at the Cowley Road Carnival
      (pictured here) and later in the year as part of the InTent City festival
      at South Park, Oxford.

      2m x 2m panel, 2007, Found driftwood, acrylic paint, calico panel -
      &amp;nbsp; This work was created  for the inside, as a central piece for
      the 'Refuge Tent'  with culturally diverse communities in East Oxford.
      Participants were asked to explore what creates a sense of home for them.
      This resulted in a variety of images ranging from flags, textile patterns
      found in domestic interiors to favourite activities and foliage. This was
      then brought together an one textile piece reflecting diversity but also
      creating a calm space for reflection and meditation.
