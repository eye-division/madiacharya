title: 20/20, Lightbox
description_markdown: >-
  My residency as part of the 20/20 Project  was at the Lightbox in Woking
  between 2022/23. I researched  the Heritage Collection at the Lightbox which
  contains many objects excavated from the grounds of Woking Palace in Old
  Woking. I was fascinated by the beautiful Valencian Tiles and made watercolour
  studies of them. I was also inspired by the ecology around the  Basingstoke
  Canal which runs close to the Lightbox. As part of the residency, I also
  visited the Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking which has beautiful patterns within
  its architecture.


  20/20 Project funded by University of Arts, London, Freelands Foundation and
  Arts Council England was at the Lightbox in Woking.
