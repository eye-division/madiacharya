title: 20/20, Lightbox
description_markdown: >-
  My residency as part of the 20/20 Project  was at the Lightbox in Woking
  between 2022/23. I researched  the Heritage Collection at the Lightbox which
  contains many objects excavated from the grounds of Woking Palace in Old
  Woking. I was fascinated by the beautiful Valencian Tiles and made watercolour
  studies of them. I was also inspired by the ecology around the  Basingstoke
  Canal which runs close to the Lightbox. As part of the residency, I also
  visited the Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking which has beautiful patterns within
  its architecture.


  During the residency I also walked along the Thames foreshore in London and
  was struck by the similarity between objects found  along the foreshore and
  those which were part of the Heritage Collection at the Lightbox, dating from
  the Tudor period.


  Following the residency and commission, the exhibition ‘I Dream a Palace’, at
  the Lightbox in 2024 show work created during the residency in dialogue with
  objects from the Heritage Collection.


  20/20 Project funded by University of Arts, London, Freelands Foundation and
  Arts Council England was at the Lightbox in Woking.
