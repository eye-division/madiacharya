title: Zig Zag Building, Glastonbury
description_markdown: >-
  In September 2024, I undertook a brief residency in the Zig Zag Building in
  Glastonbury for the project ‘Old as the hills’ the title of the project
  references the ancient hills within  the landscape of Somerset.


  During the residency I also ran a workshop which involved a nature walk,
  collecting natural materials such as sticks and debris to create small
  sculptural works.


  This relates to my own work for the residency and also my practice more
  broadly.
