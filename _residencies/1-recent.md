  This series of photographs are from the project **'Sanctuary'**, which took
  place in Kenya in July 2011. They include images of work made during the
  residency and exhibited at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi. The
  **'Sanctuary for Sick Children'** where the residency was hosted, is a charity
  that works with children who have a range of physical disabilties. Staff also
  work to make a variety of products such as paper incorporating natural
  materials such as fibre from banana trees and petals from bougainvillea petals
  of different colours.


  During the residency we collaborated with Sanctuary staff and children on a
  project where they were asked to bring objects or ideas which symbolise home
  for them. Objects including a Masai warrior's arrow , a front door key and
  text including a line from a song all became part of the project. These were
  then cast in aluminium and displayed against a backdrop of rich, dark soil
  found in this region, creating the work **'Impressions of Home'**.
