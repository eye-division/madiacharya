title: The Human Factor
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Materials found in nature can mimic parts of the human body and
  for me this is also a way of exploring issues related to the human condition
  such as alienation, difference and disease. Some of these forms have evolved
  to take on an exploration of sexual identity, offering possibilities but
  maintaining ambiguity. Discarded objects come to be adorned with decorative
  patterns from vintage textiles and lacework suggesting an intertwined male and
  female presence but at the same time defying categorization.

      interpretation.

      Fake it till you make it incorporates a piece of charred wood found whilst
      walking along the river bank in Oxford with other found materials and
      textiles. The mask refers to the idea of putting on an act until playful
      pretense becomes reality.

      Materials: Found wood, pyrography, acrylic paint, jewellery

      Dimensions (cm): W25 H60 D25, 2019


      Burning Desire is created from a piece of yew found in a forest. The wood
      is burnt into using a pyrography tool as a way of giving the sculpture a
      tattoo, comparing the surface of the wood to skin. The dolls arm jutting
      out of the side explores the possibility that disparate materials can
      coexist seamlessly, one merging effortlessly into the other.
