title: The Human Factor
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Materials found in nature can mimic parts of the human body and
  for me this is also a way of exploring issues related to the human condition
  such as alienation, difference and disease. Some of these forms have evolved
  to take on an exploration of sexual identity, offering possibilities but
  maintaining ambiguity. Discarded objects come to be adorned with decorative
  patterns from vintage textiles and lacework suggesting an intertwined male and
  female presence but at the same time defying stereotypes.
