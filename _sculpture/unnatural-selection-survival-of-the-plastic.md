title: Unnatural Selection (survival of the plastic)
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp;


  This is a series of mixed media sculptural works was inspired by coming across
  a journal which had an image of a dissected sea gullâ€™s stomach. This image
  showed all the items that the sea gull had swallowed during its life span
  which included numerous pieces of plastic. Taking this image a step further,
  new species is being created where the birds have swallowed so much plastic
  that parts of their anatomy are composed of plastic, so they come to have
  plastic beaks, wings, feet and so on. Embroidered patterns and painted
  sections are also incorporated which reference colorful patterns of some birds
  with a combination of textiles from South East Asia.
