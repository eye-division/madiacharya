  My sculptural work involves found objects and materials  juxtaposed with more natural forms such as large branches discovered in woodlands across the UK. I want to explore the tension between natural and synthetic materials, how they can co-exist and the resulting structures can come to resemble organic, sometimes alien yet recognizably human forms. Using beadwork and textiles, which originate from the South Asian Culture where I grew up, I continue to be  fascinated by sparkling jewelry, decorative accessories and ornate textile patterns from childhood.

    image_title: Non Resident Teapot
    image_description: H40 D40 W40, 2014 - &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;This work was made in response to the golden jubilee... that is how it started. I then began to think about being routed in India and still needing to get a visa to go there. So this teapot buried in crochet bearing the Indian flag is a common theme in both nations sharing a passion for the tradition of drinking tea. The title is from the term &amp;lsquo; Non resident Indian&amp;rsquo; which applies to all Indians not resident in India.

    image_title: Alps Inspired
    image_description: H15 W25 L35, 2014 - &lt;p&gt;This work was made for Oxford Grenoble 25 year twinning celebrations. I wanted to create a work that would reflect the essence of both cities, Oxford steeped in academia, represented by Harris Tweed and Grenoble surrounded by its beautiful mountain range referenced by crampons. These two aspects are brought together in one object, the work entitled &amp;lsquo;Alps Inspired&amp;rsquo;. This symbolizes personal ambition involved in climbing the mountain of academia in Oxford fused with the willpower and determination required to strive to the top of an alpine mountain in Grenoble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials - Vintage Harris Tweed, Crampons
