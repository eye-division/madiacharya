description_markdown: >-
  The Bride and Bridegroom is a pair of works which share, respectively female
  and male versions of&nbsp; tribal masks. Both&nbsp; works are created from
  single pieces of wood found in a forest and assembled with found objects which
  come to resemble aspects of the human body. Indian silks and bead work&nbsp;
  are used to convey ceremony and&nbsp; celebration.


  The Bride was exhibited in the Summer Exhibition at Royal Academy of Arts,
  2016
