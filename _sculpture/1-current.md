  In the Organic Excursions series found objects and material are combined with
  more natural forms such as large branches discovered in woodlands across the
  UK. I wanted to explore the tension between natural and synthetic materials,
  how they can co-exist and the resulting structures can come to resemble
  organic, sometimes alien yet recognizably human forms. Using beadwork and
  textiles, which originate from the South Asian Culture where I grew up, I
  continue to be fascinated by sparkling jewelry, decorative accessories and
  ornate textile patterns from childhood.

      H125 D15 W65, 2017, Found Plastic, found wood, vintage textiles, acrylic
      paint - &lt;p&gt;This work is created using a found plastic table which
      &amp;nbsp;accidentally got burned during a summer evening. The use of
      vintage fabric echoes the kind of covering which may have previously
      covered such an object when it functioned as a piece of furniture. There
      is a dialogue between natural and manufactured materials suggesting an
      apparent continuity between the disparate textures and materials so that
      pre-exiting boundaries become fused and appear as one.
