title: Intimate Obsessions
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  My sculptural work involves found objects and materials juxtaposed with more
  natural forms such as large branches discovered in woodlands across the UK. I
  want to explore the tension between natural and synthetic materials, how they
  can co-exist and the resulting structures can come to resemble organic,
  sometimes alien yet recognizably human forms. Using beadwork and textiles,
  which originate from the South Asian Culture where I grew up, I continue to be
  fascinated by sparkling jewelry, decorative accessories and ornate textile
  patterns from childhood.
