title: Tiny Obsessions
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  'Tiny Obsessions' series&nbsp; involves found objects and materials juxtaposed
  with smaller natural forms such as charred wooden blocks eroded by the
  sea.&nbsp; The more intimate scale of these works makes them feel more
  precious and ornamental. Incorporating intricate bead work and aspects of
  Indian miniature painting is a way connecting with my cultural heritage and
  deliberately slowing down the creative process in a world where things seem to
  be constantly&nbsp; in a state of flux.

      Materials: Found objects including broken tennis ball found rubber, dried
      butternut squash seeds, 


      W8.5 H32 D8.5, 2020


      This work is about influencing people and iliciting change by 
      incorporating aspects of the everyday which are usually over looked. The
      butternut squash seeds have become elevated to the level of precious beads
      and the broken tennis ball come to resemble a tribal mask. The title of
      this work is a direct reference to the seeds used, connecting this with
      the idea that one can sow the seeds of an idea so that it can come to be
      owned by whoever one is trying to persuade at any given time.
