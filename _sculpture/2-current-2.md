title: Tiny Obsessions
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  'Tiny Obsessions' series&nbsp; involves found objects and materials juxtaposed
  with smaller natural forms such as charred wooden blocks eroded by the
  sea.&nbsp; The more intimate scale of these works makes them feel more
  precious and ornamental. Incorporating intricate bead work and aspects of
  Indian miniature painting is a way connecting with my cultural heritage and
  deliberately slowing down the creative process in a world where things seem to
  be constantly&nbsp; in a state of flux.
