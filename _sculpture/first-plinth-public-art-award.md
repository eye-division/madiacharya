  **The Double Act**


  Reclaimed wood, vintage textiles, steel, jesmonite, bronze, resin


  2024


  Sculpture Terrace, Royal Society of Sculptors, London


  &nbsp;


  &nbsp;


  **The Double Act** is created in response to the theme of **‘Parade’**, for
  the First Plinth Award. 2023. This work is composed of two figures that are
  dancing together in joyous harmony, enjoying each other’s company. There is an
  emphasis on using reclaimed materials, driftwood collected from the coast for
  the platform and discarded textiles for other aspects of the piece.


  The figures are based on the natural world, trees which resemble the human
  form. This upbeat, colourful work at first glance resembles a humorous party
  scene but there are more serious undertones, namely the pressing need for us
  to value our environment, tackle climate change and value diversity.


  The last 3 images are the maquette for the final piece images 1-6.


  First Plinth Public Art Award is made possible thanks to the generosity of the
  Mirisch and Lebenheim Charitable Foundation.
