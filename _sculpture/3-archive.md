    image_description: >-
      2008, Fabric, Acrylic Paint, Found Wood -
      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jackie was made
      following adverse weather conditons, including floods on Port Meadow in
      Oxford. The moth-eaten fabric which adorns part of the surface parallels
      the decay of the wood imposed by the harsh elements. This&amp;nbsp;was
      also a way of bringing the outside world into a calmer&amp;nbsp; domestic
      interior.
