title: Frolics with Relics
description_markdown: >-
  In this series, I have purposely used objects and materials left over from a
  participatory project. I wanted to use these as they had not been 'picked ' by
  others and hence had experienced a 'double rejection', firstly being rejected
  for being obsolete and ending up as ocean waste and then being rejected again
  by not being selected by workshop participants for transformation&nbsp;
  through the creative process. The handmade paper, acrylic paint, beads are
  also materials I use in my workshops.

      Materials: Found sole, found plastic, acrylic paint

      This work was made during recent uncertain and challenging times created
      by the global pandemic. The geometric pattern is from a textile design,
      the repetitive process of painting the geometric pattern was a calming and
      meditative process which helped to deal with uncertainty and fear.
