description_markdown: >-
  **'Painting in the Street'** was project commissioned by Oxford City Council's
  East Area Parliament. Children ranging from 3-18 and their families were
  invited by **Magdalen Road Studios** to work on several 6ft by 4ft paintings.
  These were subsequently displayed along Magdalen Road and the footpath through
  SS Mary and John churchyard in Cowley Road in Oxford to celebrate Oxfordshire
  Artweeks 2010. Children worked with **Madi Acharya-Baskerville** to paint a
  **Bird Journey**, an **Underwater Journey** and a journey expressed through an
  imaginery **Map**.
