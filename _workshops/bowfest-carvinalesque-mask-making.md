title: Bowfest Carvinalesque Mask Making
description_markdown: >-
  As part of Bowfest 2025, my mixed media workshop on carnivalesque mask making
  was in celebration of Bow Arts’ 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The workshop
  focused on sustainability and connections in the community. Participants
  ranging from small children through to parents and grandparents created their
  own 3D mask using accessible discarded materials, such as egg boxes, paint,
  feathers and gems, bringing their imagination to life in unique ways.


  Review of workshop by Wan Yi Sandra Lam, Curator of Programmes & Engagement,
  Bow Arts:


  ‘*It was an absolute pleasure working with Madi for our drop-in family
  workshop at Bowfest 2025 to celebrate Bow Arts’ 30th anniversary. Madi is very
  creative in using accessible discarded materials such as egg boxes to create
  3D carnivalesque masks with our local families. I really appreciate Madi’s
  generosity for preparing the workshop materials, making samples and her
  artistic expertise in engaging with children through using mixed media and a
  range of colouring techniques. We received amazing feedback from participants
  for Madi’s workshop - it created such a fun and relaxing atmosphere at our
  biggest event of the summer. I look forward to working with Madi on our
  upcoming Bow Families sessions! ‘*
