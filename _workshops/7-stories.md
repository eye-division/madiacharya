  This was a project with men seeking assylum who were staying at the time in a
  detention centre.Participants were asked to think about water using images and
  text from their native language, a poem, a story or a saying from their
  culture of origin.For this project I collected driftwood from the coast. I
  felt this was a way of referencing the coast-line which marks the site of the
  diasporan experience,particularly significant for this group of participants..
