title: '''Cabinet of Curiosities'''
description_markdown: >-
  This project, commissioned by **Modern Art Oxford** in January 2020&nbsp;
  involved working with adults to create small scale mixed media sculptures,
  incorporating patterns of different cultures developed on hand made paper and
  found materials and objects collected in our natural environment. The objects
  and materials were especially collected for this project from the Dorset coast
  after a storm. The project was inspired by the work of **Kiki Smith** and was
  part of the public program for the exhibition '**I am a Wanderer**'. The
  concept of the '*Wunderkammer*' , a private and spiritual place created with
  the idea of nature being linked to art was key to this project. It was a way
  of exploring the boundaries between natural and artificial materials and how
  they can connect with each other. Participants created these unique and
  diverse range of sculptural works.

  **Review of workshop**


  Madi's workshop in response to the exhibition of works by Kiki Smith at Modern
  Art Oxford was a joy to attend. Her use of found materials, including
  discarded matter is a timely idea when we're all concerned about the amount of
  waste we generate these days. I would never have thought of using some of the
  objects that Madi must have gone to a lot of trouble to collect: a burst
  tennis ball, a piece of black plastic, packaging, netting. She was incredibly
  helpful with ideas and advice, so turning the materials into something
  thought-provoking and (for some participants, not so much mine\!) beautiful
  was a really enjoyable and rewarding process. I hope to have the chance to
  work with Madi again in the future.
