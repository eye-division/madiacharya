title: '''Cabinet of Curiosities'''
description_markdown: >-
  This project, commissioned by **Modern Art Oxford** in&nbsp;January 2020&nbsp;
  involved working with adults to create small scale mixed media sculptures,
  incorporating patterns of different cultures developed on hand made paper and
  found materials and objects collected in our natural environment. The objects
  and materials were especially collected for this project from the Dorset coast
  after a storm. The project was inspired by the work of **Kiki Smith** and was
  part of the public program for the exhibition '**I am a Wanderer**'. The
  concept of the '*Wunderkammer*' , a private and spiritual place created with
  the idea of nature being linked to art was key to this project. It was a way
  of exploring the boundaries between natural and artificial materials and how
  they can connect with each other. Participants created these unique and
  diverse range of sculptural works.
