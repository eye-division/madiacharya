  <p>My work is concerned with the synthesis of unlikely elements. Using objects, textiles, song, conversation and magazine cuttings which resonate with me on some level, I create works which move fluidly between different media. Often materials used have had a previous life such as wooden panels previously part of furniture or embroidered fabric which has become moth-eaten, hence devoid of its original function. I am interested in the disintegration of objects and materials over time and how through my intervention they can come to exist as part of something new.</p>
