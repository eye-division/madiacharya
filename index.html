  <p>Madi Acharya-Baskerville is an Asian born diaspora artist, living and working in the UK. Broadly speaking, the themes explored in her work range from environmental concerns, migration and exile and gender issues. What unities them is the found element, matter that already exists around us, an enduring reflection of the human condition. Her practice involves the synthesis of unlikely elements which she sources from different locations, the coastline, woodlands and vintage markets.&nbsp; Using objects, textiles, song, conversation and magazine cuttings which resonate with her on some level, she creates works which move fluidly between different media. Some of the materials have had a past life such as wooden panels previously part of furniture or embroidered textiles which have seen better occasions. Through joyous transformative processes these objects and materials are reborn as part of something new.</p>
