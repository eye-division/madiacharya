title: Tyre Paintings
description_markdown: >-
  This series of works has developed in response to finding eroded tyres and
  rubber washed up in abundance along the coast line. The mixed media paintings
  are framed by found rubber giving them the appearance of a porthole, like
  being out at sea. The use of eroded rubber tyres also symbolizes many
  different&nbsp; journeys and glimpses into other worlds.
