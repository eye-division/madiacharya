title: Fragmented Worlds
_hide_content: true
description_markdown: >-
  Fragmented Worlds&nbsp; is a series of works capturing&nbsp; a sense of loss,
  a nostalgia for lost origins which simultaneously hint at new beginnings,
  discovering unseen places some of which are within our imagination. Images are
  collaged together from different&nbsp; experiences rather than a product of
  stark reality. The found surface itself has a past, marked, textured,
  battered, worn out hence marking time whilst the irregular edges suggest a
  continuity beyond what can be viewed.
