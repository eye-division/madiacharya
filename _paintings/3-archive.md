    This ongoing series of paintings/constructions make use of found images and text from newspapers and magazines. Using such imagery she reflects on recent disasters, exploitation of the East through cheap labour and global tourism. She is interested in the darker aspects of our response to a beautiful image- what lies beyond a beach lined with dreamy palm trees. There may be a darker presence in the shadow which comes to light through terrorism, natural disaster and other forms of violation.
