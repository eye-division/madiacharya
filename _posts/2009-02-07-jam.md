Jam: Cultural Congestions in Contemporary Asian Art
7 Feb -5 April 2009, An Exhibition at South Hill Park Art Centre,Ringmead, Bracknell http://www.southhillpark.org.uk. 
As populations surge and international migration grows steadily, the movement of people, objects and identities are activities that have taken on a political and cultural character of their own. This exhibition explores the concept of cultural congestion in visual art practice.
