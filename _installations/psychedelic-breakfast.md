  Psychedelic Breakfast, 2016


  Plywood, collage, acrylic paint


  This work was created&nbsp; especially for **Vinyl Deptford** as part of the
  **Deptford X Fringe**. It was inspired by psychedelia and the fusion of
  musical genres. The&nbsp; concertina book is made out of wood, with pages the
  dimensions of a 7‚Äù single&nbsp; inspired by some of the iconic album covers of
  60s and 70s.
