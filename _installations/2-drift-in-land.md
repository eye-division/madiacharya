  Drift-in-land


  Site-specific work at the Abbey at Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire,


  2015


  This site-specific work was created for the exhibition ‘Unravelling Time’ at
  The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay Abbey, a magical place steeped in history and
  atmosphere. My piece is created from found objects that I collected from
  Chapman’s Pool on the Dorset coast. Through this work I wanted to bring
  artifacts from the shoreline, the edge of our land into a more inland space
  within the gardens in the Abbey. The trip to source materials for this project
  was made possible by funding from Axisweb100
