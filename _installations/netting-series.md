title: Netting Series
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Netting Series are all hanging works. **‘On being purple’**
  and&nbsp; **‘Take Possession’** both use a single piece of washed up netting
  found on a deserted beach on the Dorset coast. Ghost nets, fishing nets that
  have been abandoned, lost or discarded at sea, beaches or in harbours are
  particularly concerning because of the devastation they cause to marine life.
  Using vintage silk textiles from South Asia is also a way of referencing the
  journeys of women across oceans from distant lands. &nbsp;**‘Behind the
  bonnet’** and **‘The orange element’** use similar materials. The latter also
  has its origins in the depths of lockdown. The broken pieces of debris are
  pieced together to create a single hair like mass, is a metaphor for trying to
  repair and rebuild what has been lost as a result of the pandemic.
