title: Netting Series
description_markdown: >-
  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Netting Series are all hanging works. **‘Tobermory
  Pendulum’** is inspired by a trip to Isle of Mull, Scotland and the memory of
  encountering a buoy in the middle of a forest close to a river estuary. This
  encounter is a reminder of how time is ticking by in the midst of mounting
  river and ocean pollution.**‘On being purple’** and&nbsp; **‘Take
  Possession’** both use a single piece of washed up netting found on a deserted
  beach on the Dorset coast. Ghost nets, fishing nets that have been abandoned,
  lost or discarded at sea, beaches or in harbours are particularly concerning
  because of the devastation they cause to marine life. Using vintage silk
  textiles from South Asia is also a way of referencing the journeys of women
  across oceans from distant lands. &nbsp;**‘Behind the bonnet’** and **‘The
  orange element’** use similar materials. The latter also has its origins in
  the depths of lockdown. The broken pieces of debris are pieced together to
  create a single hair like mass, is a metaphor for trying to repair and rebuild
  what has been lost as a result of the pandemic.
