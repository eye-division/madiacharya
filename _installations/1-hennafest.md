  Commissioned for Oxford Festival of the Arts and installed in an Indian tent,
  2017


  Materials: Found wood, found bedspring, mixed media


  This work brings together the rich tradition of body painting with Henna which
  is associated with festivals and special occasions in India. For example, the
  day before a wedding ceremony the bride to-be may be in the company of her
  friends and family having her hands adorned with beautiful patterns painted in
  henna. The collaged aspects from newspaper reference a yearning and a love for
  exoticism, an escape from reality sometimes found in newspapers in the UK.
