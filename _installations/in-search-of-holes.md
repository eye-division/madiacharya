title: In search of holes
description_markdown: >-
  This site responsive work **‘In search of holes’**  was created for a London
  gallery space close to the site of the hidden Wallbrook river  ** ** as a way
  of thinking about route of the hidden river and how it trickles out through a
  hole close to the Thames nearby. These holes suggest possibilities for
  attachment, for joining up together as well as offering portals into other
  worlds.
