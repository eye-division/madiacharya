  'I will go where ever you take me', at &nbsp;hARTslane Gallery, 2019


  Found wood, muslin, raw silk, Bengali text


  Dimensions: 184 x 121 x 125 cms


  &nbsp; This site specific work is based on the idea of home as a transient
  space&nbsp; shifting according to need and circumstance. The work takes its
  title from a translation of the appliqued text on both sides, written in
  Bengali meaning ‘ I will go wherever you take me’.


  &nbsp;&nbsp; The tent being a mobile structure that can be moved and set up in
  different locations refers to the idea of a nomadic existence rather than
  feeling settled in one place.&nbsp; The idea of home is presented as
  something, which is rootless, transient and uncertain. The frame is
  constructed out of driftwood, symbolizing journeys across oceans with origins
  in other lands.


  &nbsp; &nbsp; A home may be a clearing within a forest, a camp in the middle
  of a desert, an island surrounded by the sea. The sense of the outside as the
  place of threat and the unknown heightens the significance of home as the
  place of comfort, safety and protection.
