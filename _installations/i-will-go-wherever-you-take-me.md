title: I will go wherever you take me
description_markdown: >-
  ‘I will go where ever you take me’ is based on the idea of home as a transient
  space&nbsp; shifting according to need and circumstance.


  In folklore, the significance of the home is defined by its relationship to
  the outside.


  A home may be a clearing within a forest, a camp in the middle of a desert, an
  island surrounded by the sea. Beyond the clearing lies the devil. Away from
  the camp there are no signs of life. Out in the sea changes occur without
  notice. This sense of the outside as the place of threat and the unknown
  heightens the significance of home as the place of safety, order and even
  divine protection.


  The tent being a mobile structure that can be moved and set up in different
  locations refers to the idea of a nomadic existence rather than feeling
  settled in one place.&nbsp; The idea of home is presented as something, which
  is rootlessness, temporary, unsettling and uncertain. The frame is constructed
  out of driftwood, which symbolizes journeys across oceans, originating in
  other lands.


  The use of muslin creates a transparent space where it is possible to see in
  but not so clearly hence obscuring what may or may not lie within. There is
  intentionally no definite entrance creating a kind of frustration of not being
  able to enter a space for shelter, which may potentially be suitable for
  habitation.


  The work takes its title from a translation of the appliqued text on both
  sides, written in Bengali meaning is ‘ I will go wherever you take me’. The
  fabric used for the text is embroidered raw silk,. Although the text is the
  same on both sides, on one side the reverse side of the fabric is used. This
  is a way of highlighting what is usually overlooked but may be interesting in
  its own right, showing the workings of the embroidered piece.


  The ties used to attach the muslin are made from another piece of raw silk and
  also the cotton lining of silk used to make the appliqued text. All the ties
  are made by hand and in doing so I was thinking of family ties, memories and
  nostalgia. When my grandmother came to visit the UK we took her on various
  trips and would often ask her where she wanted to go and she would reply ‘ I
  will go wherever you take me’. Hence the phrase relates to the idea of being
  transported, both real and imagined.
