title: Pull the wool over my eyes
description_markdown: >-
  This  work was created during a brief residency in the Zig Zag building in
  Glastonbury for the project ‘ As old as the hills’. It was a unique space, a
  building from the Bauhaus period, previously a factory.


  This work is created from sticks collected on Chesil Beach, Dorset, discarded
  textiles and wool in the form of pom poms. The form the work takes responds to
  the space and specifically the windows which create an expansive geometric
  backdrop overlooking the rural landscape of Somerset.
