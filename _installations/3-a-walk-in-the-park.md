  A Walk in the Park at Angus Hughes Gallery, London, 2018


  Dimension variable, for space H250 x W200 X L200 cm


  Materials: found wood, textiles, beadwork, acrylic paint


  This work reflects the darker aspects of human nature, an upbeat walk through
  a park under blue sky surrounded by flowers can also have darker undertones.
  Reference to a woodland setting implies a sense of mystery, the dialectic
  between good and evil often found in fairy tales. As the German poet Schiller
  wrote:&nbsp;


  â€˜The fairy tale hero proceeds for a time in isolation, as the modern child
  often feels isolated. The hero is helped by being in touch with primitive
  things, a tree, an animal, nature as the child feels more in touch with those
  things than most adults do'.
