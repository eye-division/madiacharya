title: I wish my hair was as long as yours
description_markdown: >-
  **'I wish my hair was as long as yours'** is an evolving sculptural
  installation exploring longing, desire and female identity, incorporating the
  found netting and family textiles. This work also takes inspiration from a
  particular historical Indian miniature painting, entitled ‘**Krishna and the
  cowgirls’ clothes’**. It shows some women with long hair bathing in a lily
  pond, they all have long hair dripping wet, and are comparing the length of
  each other’s hair, before they realize that Lord Krishna has stolen all their
  clothes which he has hung neatly on a branch overlooking the pond. The
  textiles at the top of the unraveled netting are a reference to the clothes of
  these bathers, hence incorporating this particular aspect of the story.
